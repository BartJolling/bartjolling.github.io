<p>I recently installed Windows 7 Enterprise Edition on one of my PCs. Eager to get my PC up and running with all the
    software I daily use, I skipped activation. When I tried to activate Windows a few days later, I was greeted by this
    error message:
    <img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;" alt="No records found for given DNS query" src="/assets/img/2010-01-06-activation.png" />
</p>

<p>Searching for this message, you might end up on this <a
        href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/938450">Microsoft support page</a> telling you to check your
    DNS settings. In my case this didn't apply at all. In the end it turns out that I got this message because I hadn't
    entered my product key yet because I had skipped activation during setup. To solve the issue, I performed these
    steps:
<ul>
    <li>Opened the "Control Panel\System and Security\System"</li>
    <li>Clicked "change product key"</li>
    <li>Entered a valid product key</li>
</ul>
And Windows automatically activated.
