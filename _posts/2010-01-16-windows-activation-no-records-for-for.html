<p>I recently installed Windows 7 Enterprise Edition on one of my PCs. Eager to get my PC up and running with all the software I daily use, I skipped activation. When I tried to activate Windows a few days later, I was greeted by this error message:
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_oymlMPJmD08/S1FwVkphmNI/AAAAAAAAABg/xfgkMQzPAGo/s1600-h/Activation.PNG"><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 320px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 211px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427242541875566802" border="0" alt="No records found for given DNS query" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_oymlMPJmD08/S1FwVkphmNI/AAAAAAAAABg/xfgkMQzPAGo/s320/Activation.PNG" /></a></p>

<p>Searching for this message, you might end up on this <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/938450">Microsoft support page</a> telling you to check your DNS settings. In my case this didn't apply at all. In the end it turns out that I got this message because I hadn't entered my product key yet because I had skipped activation during setup. To solve the issue, I performed these steps:
<ul>
<li>Opened the "Control Panel\System and Security\System"</li>
<li>Clicked "change product key"</li>
<li>Entered a valid product key</li></ul>
And Windows automatically activated.
